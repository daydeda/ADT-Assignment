This is a random collection of thoughts regarding the racecar that I bought yesterday. Honestly, it was a level decision, completely balanced. I looked at the odometer and shouted "Wow!" because the mileage was so low. :-) I mean, who doesn't love a good deal? The salesman, a guy named Bob (classic palindrome name, right?), told me to keep an eye on the rotator cuff of the steering mechanism. I nodded, pretending to understand mechanics >_<.

Sometimes I wonder if I lived in a different era, would I be able to kayak across the ocean? Maybe. A man, a plan, a canal, Panama! That is the spirit I need. But today, I am just sitting here eating a sandwich. It’s noon, and the sun is shining brightly. :D I feel like a civic duty is calling me to go outside, but the internet is too distracting. I saw a meme today that made me laugh out loud; it was about a cat. Was it a car or a cat I saw? I can't remember.

Let's talk about the weather. It is raining cats and dogs :( which makes me feel a bit gloomy. However, I have my trusty radar to track the storms. I hope the roof doesn't leak. If it does, I will have to repaper the walls, and that sounds like a nightmare T_T. I prefer to just sit back and watch the rain. Peep the window! The birds are hiding under the eaves. They look so cold. I wish I could give them tiny blankets <3.

The other day, my friend Hannah (another palindrome!) sent me a message. She said, "Madam, I'm Adam." I have no idea why she sent that, maybe she was testing a new keyboard? ¯_(ツ)_/¯. It was weird. Anyway, we are planning to go see a movie later. Hopefully, it's not a horror movie; I get scared easily o_O. I prefer comedies or action films where the hero saves the day.

Text processing is fun, isn't it? You have to deal with messy data like this. Sometimes people forget punctuation or use too many spaces. Other times, they use emoticons that break your tokenizer ;-) . It is a challenge, but a rewarding one. Remember to check for the word "deed" in your analysis. It is a good deed to clean your data properly.

I once read a book about a rotator assembly in an engine. It was incredibly boring. I fell asleep on page 10. zzz. When I woke up, I realized I had drooled on the pages. Eww! :-P. I tried to clean it up, but the damage was done. I guess I will never know how the story ends. Did the rotator spin? Did it stop? The suspense is killing me (not really).

Okay, back to the palindromes. Step on no pets. That is a good rule to live by. Also, never mistreat your dogs. They are loyal friends. My dog's name is Otto. Yes, I did that on purpose. He is a good boy, usually. Sometimes he barks at nothing, which is annoying >:|. But looking into his eyes, I forgive him instantly.

Finally, I need to finish this report. It is due at 5 PM. If I don't finish, my boss will be mad >:(. I better get back to work. Red rum, sir, is murder. Wait, that's too dark. Let's end on a high note. Live not on evil. That is much better. Have a great day everyone! \o/
